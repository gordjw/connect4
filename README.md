This is a small demo I put together to learn React & NextJS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to play the most thoroughly complete game of connect 4 ever!
